/*
ðŸ“Œ Program: Standard Deviation Calculation
ðŸ“‚ File Name: Standard-Deviation-Calculation.cpp

ðŸ§  Approach:
1. Given a fixed array of 15 integers, we are calculating the **standard deviation**.
2. First, calculate the **mean** (average) of all elements.
3. Then, compute the sum of squares of differences between each element and the mean.
4. Finally, use the standard deviation formula:  
        Ïƒ = sqrt(Î£((xáµ¢ - Î¼)Â²) / n)
   where:
     - Ïƒ is the standard deviation
     - Î¼ is the mean
     - xáµ¢ is each element
     - n is the number of elements

âœ… Output: It will print the standard deviation value of the array.

ðŸ”§ Time Complexity: O(n) â€” as we iterate through the array twice.
